    change this behavior so that only a line containing exactly ``text``
    results in a True return value.

    None is returned immediately. Otherwise, the given text is appended to the
    end of the given ``filename`` via e.g. ``echo '$text' >> $filename``.

    The test for whether ``text`` already exists defaults to a full line match,
    e.g. ``^<text>$``, as this seems to be the most sensible approach for the
    "append lines to a file" use case. You may override this and force partial
    searching (e.g. ``^<text>``) by specifying ``partial=True``.

    Because ``text`` is single-quoted, single quotes will be transparently
    backslash-escaped. This can be disabled with ``escape=False``.
