Installation
============

If you haven't done so already, install Fabric. See Fabric's installation `instructions <https://www.fabfile.org/installing.html>`_ for guidance.

Patchwork is best installed via `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`_::

    $ pip install patchwork

Development
===========

To develop Patchwork (or even just run the test suite), you'll need the libraries listed in the ``dev-requirements.txt`` (included in the source distribution.) Usually it's
easy to simply ``pip install -r dev-requirements.txt``.
