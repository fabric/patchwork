    """
    Convenient wrapper around your friendly local ``rsync``.

    Specifically, it calls your local ``rsync`` program via a subprocess, and
    fills in its arguments with Fabric's current target host/user/port. It
    provides Python level keyword arguments for some common rsync options, and
    allows you to specify custom options via a string if required (see below.)

    For details on how ``rsync`` works, please see its manpage. ``rsync`` must
    be installed on both the invoking system and the target in order for this
    function to work correctly.

    .. note::
        This function transparently honors the given
        `~fabric.connection.Connection`'s connection parameters such as port
        number and SSH key path.

    .. note::
        For reference, the approximate ``rsync`` command-line call that is
        constructed by this function is the following::

            rsync [--delete] [--exclude exclude[0][, --exclude[1][, ...]]] \\
                -pthrvz [rsync_opts] <source> <host_string>:<target>

    :param c:
        `~fabric.connection.Connection` object upon which to operate.
    :param str source:
        The local path to copy from. Actually a string passed verbatim to
        ``rsync``, and thus may be a single directory (``"my_directory"``) or
        multiple directories (``"dir1 dir2"``). See the ``rsync`` documentation
        for details.
    :param str target:
        The path to sync with on the remote end. Due to how ``rsync`` is
        implemented, the exact behavior depends on the value of ``source``:

        - If ``source`` ends with a trailing slash, the files will be dropped
          inside of ``target``. E.g. ``rsync(c, "foldername/",
          "/home/username/project")`` will drop the contents of ``foldername``
          inside of ``/home/username/project``.
        - If ``source`` does **not** end with a trailing slash, ``target`` is
          effectively the "parent" directory, and a new directory named after
          ``source`` will be created inside of it. So ``rsync(c, "foldername",
          "/home/username")`` would create a new directory
          ``/home/username/foldername`` (if needed) and place the files there.

    :param exclude:
        Optional, may be a single string or an iterable of strings, and is
        used to pass one or more ``--exclude`` options to ``rsync``.
    :param bool delete:
        A boolean controlling whether ``rsync``'s ``--delete`` option is used.
        If True, instructs ``rsync`` to remove remote files that no longer
        exist locally. Defaults to False.
    :param bool strict_host_keys:
        Boolean determining whether to enable/disable the SSH-level option
        ``StrictHostKeyChecking`` (useful for frequently-changing hosts such as
        virtual machines or cloud instances.) Defaults to True.
    :param str rsync_opts:
        An optional, arbitrary string which you may use to pass custom
        arguments or options to ``rsync``.
    :param str ssh_opts:
        Like ``rsync_opts`` but specifically for the SSH options string
        (rsync's ``--rsh`` flag.)
    :param bool remote_to_local:
        boolean flag that indicate whether you want to sync from
        remote to local. By default it is sync from local to remote.
